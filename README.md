A Python tool to discover devices on a subnet and scan ports on a single host.

Network discovery requires a subnet prefix (e.g., `192.168.1.`).  
Port scanning requires a full IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).

## Usage

### 1. Discover devices in a subnet
Scan `.1` to `.255` in the provided subnet prefix:
```bash
python discover.py -ip 192.168.16.
```
### 2. Scan ports on a specific device
Scan ports 80 to 100 on a full IP:
```bash
python discover.py -ip 192.168.16.5 -p -s 80 -e 100
```
### 3. Use custom number of workers (threads)
   ```bash
python discover.py -ip 192.168.16.5 -p -s 20 -e 80 -m 50
```

## Notes
- Network discovery = subnet prefix only.
- Port scanning = full IP only.
